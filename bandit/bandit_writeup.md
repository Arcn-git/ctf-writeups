# Bandit Write-up

The following document is a personal writeup for the bandit ctf wargame at [I'm an inline-style link](https://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/). It is not open for sharing but only for my own monitoring of learning. Don't spoil yourself of the fun kiddo.

## Level 0
First level is easy, you just use the manual for ssh and find out how to connect to a specific port.
```bash
# The syntax is ssh username@host -p portnumber
ssh bandit0@bandit.labs.overthewire.org -p 2220
```
